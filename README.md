# Bikeshare
1st project of Udacity course(Data Analysis Professional)

## **Project Details:**
Using Python 3.7.4, NumPy, and pandas to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities 
in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### **Bike Share Data:**
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.
This project will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### **The Datasets:**
Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:
-	Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
-	End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
- Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
-	Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
-	End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
-	User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
-	Gender
-	Birth Year
